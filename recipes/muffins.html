        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>⅓ cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>⅓ cup milk, or more as needed</li>
            <li>1 cup fresh blueberries</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 8 muffin cups or line with muffin liners.</li>
            <li>Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Pour oil into a small liquid measuring cup. Add egg and enough milk to reach the 1-cup mark. Stir until combined. Pour into flour mixture and mix just until batter is combined. Fold in blueberries. Set batter aside.</li>
            <li>Combine sugar, flour, butter, and cinnamon for crumb topping in a small bowl. Mix with a fork until crumbly.</li>
            <li>Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling right to the top. Sprinkle with crumb topping.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
